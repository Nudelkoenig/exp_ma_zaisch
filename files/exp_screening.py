"""Custom classes for participant screening and filtering in Alfred 3

author: Christian Treffenstädt
updated: 2022-03-29

Dev notes:

Currently, there are three possible use cases I can think of:

1. The most common use case: Screening participants and participant
   logging within the same experiment. Participants are screened at the
   beginning of an experiment and their participation is either logged
   instantaneously (on hiding of the screening page) or on one of the
   following pages > Implementation finished

2. Participant logging without screening. This will occur often, as we
   might conduct an experiment for which screening is not necessary but
   we want to log participation for future screening purposes.

3. Screening without logging. There are two scenarios in which the
   screening page might be used without participation logging. The more
   common scenario involves using on-page screening elements but
   deactivating mail-based screening altogether. The less common
   scenario would involve mail-based screening without participant
   logging. This might be useful for small pilot studies, but should not
   occur often.

As a result, mail-based filtering on the screening page, on-page
screening elements, and participation checks should be implemented
independently of each other. Nonetheless, all methods should work together
if they are activated.

class ScreeningPage(al.Page):
    """
    Provides different options to filter participants.

    The *ScreeningPage* can be added to an experiment to filter
    participants in three ways:

        * Users can add input elements, preferably through the page's
          :meth:`alfred3.page.Page.on_first_show` method, and filter
          participants based on their answers to these screening elements
          by overriding :meth:`.validate_screening_elements`. The
          experiment session will then be aborted based on the methods
          return value.
        * If users have access to an instance of mortimer (version 0.8.2
          or higher), they can use mortimer's participation check feature
          (:ref:`https://github.com/ctreffe/mortimer/wiki/Check-participation`)
          to filter participants based on their recorded participation to
          the current and other experiments.
        * Users can pass lists with email addresses against which the
          participant's email is compared. If the email is found on any of
          the lists, the experiment session will be aborted.

    All three methods work both independently and in combination with any
    of the other methods. See the example section for further information.

    Args:
        email_screening (bool): If *True* a
            :class:`alfred3.element.input.RegEntry` element and a data
            protection disclaimer are added on the top of the page,
            prompting the participant to enter an email address for
            which both mortimer's participation check or the comparison
            against email address lists can be performed. Defaults to
            *True*.
        part_check_filter (dict): Contains nested dictionaries with the
            necessary information to perform a participation check with
            mortimer. The dictionary keys can be freely chosen and
            function as labels which are used in log entries regarding the
            screening results. A nested dictionary must contain an
            'exp_id' key with a valid exp_id value. To perform a version
            specific participation check the dictionary may also contain
            an 'exp_version' key with a valid version value.
        mail_list_filter (dict): Contains lists of email addresses (as
            strings). The dictionary keys can be freely chosen and
            function as labels which are used in log entries regarding the
            screening results.
        mortimer_url (str): The URL to a mortimer instance v0.8.2 or
            newer. The email screening feature of this page will access
            mortimer's */participation* route if a participant check
            and/or registration is performed.
        content (dict): Contains customized texts and configurations for
            the page. Defaults to a dictionary with minimal examples.
        repeated_participation (bool): Only relevant if *email_screening*
            is *True*. If this is set to *False* users are prevented from
            repeatedly participating in the current experiment by adding
            the current experiment and version to the *part_check_filter*.
            Other versions of the experiment need to be added manually.
        register_on_hiding (bool): If set to *True* the participation for
            the specified email address will be registered with mortimer
            on leaving the page in any direction. Defaults to *True*. See
            the examples below on how to postpone the participation
            registration to a later page in the experiment.

    Examples:

        1. Participation check with immediate participation registration

        2. Email list filtering with immediate participation registration

        3. Screening elements example without participation registration

        4. Screening elements and participation check with postponed
           participation registration

        5. Immediate participation registration without screening

        6. Postponed participation registration without screening

    Todo: Add examples.
